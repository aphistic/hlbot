HLBot Installation
------------------

Ok, on to the fun stuff!
This assumes you're already in the hlbot root
directory (hlbot-0.3.x).

1. Edit include/config.h as you see fit (not
   necessary but you may want to)

2. make OR IF YOU ARE ON FreeBSD use gmake

3. cd modules

4. ./cstrike.sh

5. cd ..

6. make install if you want hlbot in a different folder(it will ask you where)

7. Edit hlbot.cfg to fit your setup.

8. Run hlbot by typing either ./hlbot or
   ./hlbot --help to see the other options
