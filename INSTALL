HLBot Installation
------------------

Installation is really simple at the moment, just a few steps are involved:

1. Check include/config.h to make sure CONFIGLOC is a path to where you want
   the config file for HLBot stored.
2. make
3. Copy hlbot.cfg to the location you specified in CONFIGLOC and modify as 
   needed
4. Copy hlbot to and location you'd like (or even leave it where it is)
5. Add the following 4 lines to your server.cfg on your Half-Life server:
   
   logaddress <ip of server where hlbot is running> <port hlbot listens on>
   mp_logmessages 1
   mp_logdetail 3
   log on
   
6. Run hlbot

You're all set!
