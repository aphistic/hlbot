HLBot Installation
------------------

This beta doesn't have a very friendly install at the moment, but
it's not too bad. :)

1. Check include/config.h to make sure CONFIGLOC is a path to 
   where you want the config file for HLBot stored.
2. make
3. Copy hlbot.cfg to the location you specified in CONFIGLOC and modify as 
   needed
4. Copy hlbot to and location you'd like (or even leave it where it is)
5. Add the following 4 lines to your server.cfg on your Half-Life server:
   
   logaddress <ip of server where hlbot is running> <port hlbot listens on>
   mp_logmessages 1
   mp_logdetail 3
   log on
6. Go into the modules directory and type ./cstrike.sh to compile the
   HLBot cstrike module.
7. Create a directory where you copied the hlbot binary called modules
   and copy cstrike.so into that directory.
6. Run hlbot
