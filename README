HLBot
Copyright (C) 2002  Erik Davidson

HLBot is an IRC bot that displays what's happening on a Half-Life server
in real time.  It now also allows for IRC to Half-Life chat.

Currently the only Half-Life game supported is Counter-Strike, but eventually
I hope to add support for TFC, plain Half-Life and any other mods people request.

Installation notes are in the INSTALL file.

HLBot is released under the GNU Public License, read LICENSE for more info.
If you make any changes to HLBot I'd like it if you could send it to me at
erik@erikd.org.  I want to see what kinda stuff people are doing with my baby. :)
