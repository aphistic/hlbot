Copyright (C) 2002  Erik Davidson

HLBot is an IRC bot that displays what's happening on a Half-Life 
server in IRC.I'm really bad at making docs, so this is what you 
get for now until someone feels like writing me some good stuff. :)

Installation notes are in the INSTALL file.

Commands
--------
Type these in IRC:

!help - Displays the commands HLBot understands

                          and port are optional)

HLBot is released under the GNU Public License, read LICENSE for more 
info. If you make any changes to HLBot I'd like it if you could send 
it to me at erik@erikd.org.  I want to see what kinda stuff people are 
doing with my baby. :)
