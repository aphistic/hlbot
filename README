HLBot
Copyright (C) 2002  Erik Davidson

HLBot is an IRC bot that displays what's happening on a Half-Life 
server in IRC.I'm really bad at making docs, so this is what you 
get for now until someone feels like writing me some good stuff. :)

Before we get into the all the other stuff, I have some people I
need to thank :)

|id|rebel from GamesNet for all the suggestions and testing
darien from GamesNet for suggestions and beta testing
haggai from OpenProjects for coding/cvs help
drippy from RogueNet for original testing
and all the rest of you that've helped out, thanks!

Installation notes are in the INSTALL file.
