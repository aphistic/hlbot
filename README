HLBot
Copyright (C) 2002  Erik Davidson

HLBot is an IRC bot that displays what's happening on a Half-Life 
server in IRC.I'm really bad at making docs, so this is what you 
get for now until someone feels like writing me some good stuff. :)

Before we get into the all the other stuff, I have some people I
need to thank :)
---
darien from GamesNet for all the suggestions and testing
|id|rebel from GamesNet for all the suggestions and testing
haggai from OpenProjects for coding/cvs help
drippy from RogueNet for original testing
and all the rest of you that've helped out, thanks!

Installation notes are in the INSTALL file.

If any of you are good at writing docs I'd appreciate some help,
as you can see I'm not too good. ;)
