HLBot
Copyright (C) 2002  Erik Davidson

HLBot is an IRC bot that displays what's happening on a Half-Life server
in real time.  It now also allows for IRC to Half-Life chat.

Currently the only Half-Life game supported is Counter-Strike, but eventually
I hope to add support for TFC, plain Half-Life and any other mods people request.

Installation notes are in the INSTALL file.

Commands

help - Displays the commands HLBot understands

                         are optional)

If you make any changes to HLBot I'd like it if you could send it to me at
erik@erikd.org.  I want to see what kinda stuff people are doing with my baby. :)
